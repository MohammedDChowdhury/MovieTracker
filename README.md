# MovieTracker
Simple Android Application â€“ Tracking/Organising Movies 
Some features/buttons/screens are currently in works. 
A full-stack application designed to help users keep track of what movies they have watched or would like to watch. 
The user-facing application is a native android app, which I wrote in Java on Android Studio. 
I used an SQLite database to store the data and wrote a thin server-side API as a wrapper around the database.
